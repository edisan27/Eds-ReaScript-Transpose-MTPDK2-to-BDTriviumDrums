# Ed's - MT: Power DrumKit 2 to Bogren Digital: Trivium Drums ReaScript (.lua) [![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lua-%232C2D72.svg?logo=lua&logoColor=white)](#)
REAPER Version: 7.34 (I think?) at the time the code was written, but they do updates very often!

## What is this?
REAPER (DAW) script to transpose an existing DrumMap from [MT's Power Drumkit 2](https://www.powerdrumkit.com/) to [Bogren Digital's Trivium Drums](https://bogrendigital.com/products/trivium-drums?srsltid=AfmBOooJfjhj0WQdL8lsaJdSPs80QVX91T9myG3XssOM-faz7DaHGsDk).

### Personal use case: 
I use it very rarely, because I used to program MIDI drums with MT Power DrumKit 2 sampler VST, I did a lot of demo tracks with that, and now I have Bogren Digital Trivium Drums Kontakt Player library, the mapping differences felt very drastic, and I wanted to utilize every single drums of the library, so I made this automation tool for quicker transition. Probably won't use it again in the future but maybe I will expand it to be more useful.

## To Do:
- [ ] Not much, maybe better mapping (?)  
- [ ] Branching it to multiple drums to drums map conversion, EZDrummer2 seems to be the most used ones kinda a standard, maybe I'll make remaper for that
